                There was something different in the air on the day when he
                appeared, something mysterious and filled with possibility. He

                After the Paper Merchant set up his stall, all of the seeds were
                giddy with anticipation.

              <Text pt="6">
                "I wonder what my gardener is like!" exclaimed one seed of
                wonder.

              <Text pt="6">
                "I can't wait to meet my gardener!" said a seed of passion.

              <Text pt="6">"This is a great day!" said a seed of power.</Text>
              <Text pt="6">
                The stall opened, and gardeners lined up, each claiming their
                seeds. Every time a gardener and seed matched, the seed beamed
                with happiness, excited to begin its journey with its chosen
                gardener.
              </Text>

                However, as the days went by, and the line of gardeners went
                away, some of the seeds began to worry. "I hope my gardener
                didn't forget about me," said a seed of hope.
              </Text>
              <Text pt="6">
                Every day, only a few gardeners came to unite with their seeds.
                Those lucky chosen seeds were happy, but the rest began to
                realize the cold truth that they might not be united with their
                gardener at all.
              </Text>
              <Text pt="6">
                Finally, the moment came, it was time for the Paper Merchant to
                go, and the remaining seeds gasped as they realized their fate:
                they would remain without a gardener.
              </Text>
              <Text pt="6">
                One of the Seeds of Passion shrieked, "What will we do???"
              </Text>
              <Text pt="6">
                The Paper Merchant, who had been silent all this while, got up
                and spoke calmly.
              </Text>
              <Text pt="6">
                "The gardeners that you all chose did not make it."

              <Text pt="6">
                "How will we ever grow? Is this the end for us?" asked a seed of
                Wonder.
              </Text>
              <Text pt="6">
                "It will not be easy." responded the Paper Merchant, "and true
                happiness will be a challenge to find, but there is still a way
                for you".

                "I will search for foster gardeners. Those who are willing to

                Who are the gardeners willing to care for sad seeds, and how
                will the Paper Merchant find them. It will all become clear in
                the days to come.
